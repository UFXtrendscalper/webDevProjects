/*
Challenge:
Style the app according to the provided design.
The font is called "Happy Monkey" and can be
embedded via Google Fonts.

Don't know how to make an image round? Google it!
Also, consider how you should select the image 
(class vs id vs element selector).
*/

/*
Challenge:
Add a thin blurred border around the <h1>, <h2>, 
and <h4> using the text-shadow technique you 
learned in the Space Exploration section. Set
the blur to 1px and the color to black.
*/

/*
Challenge:
First, wrap the HTML elements in a <div> with an 
id called "header".

Then, select the "header" and use flexbox to achieve
the layout you've been provided in the design slide.
*/

/*
Challenge:
1. Create a "gift-section" <div> that will wrap
   all the elements for the first gift.
2. Add the <h2>, <h3>, and <img> elements, and
   give all of them their own classes.
3. Style the elements according to the design.

PS: the image should be 400px wide.
*/

/*
Challenge:
Create the next GIFt (hot.gif). Its HTML structure 
should be like the previous one, but without the 
"gift-hint" element.

However, now that you have multiple GIFts on the page,
you cannot use the "gift-img" class to set the GIF 
background-image(s) on :hover. Each GIFt will need a 
unique id that controls which background image that 
should be shown when hovering over the element.
*/

/*
Challenge:
Create the "genius" and "badass" GIFt sections.

Texts:
If I had to describe you with ONE word ðŸ‘‡

The only person as badass as you ðŸ’ª

*/

/*
Challenge:
Create the "cheers" GIFt section.

Note: this GIFt should have a height of 200px. 
Select the #gift-img-cheers id and override 
the height that the element got from the 
.gift-img class.

Text: 
This one's for you, my friend ðŸ¥‚
