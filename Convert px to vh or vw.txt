Converting 1px to vh or vw depends on the actual size of the viewport because 1px is a fixed unit, while vh and vw are fluid and change with the viewport. To find the equivalent of 1px in vh or vw, you'd need to know the viewport's dimensions in pixels.

Here's how you can calculate it:
	1PX IN VH:: 1px = (1/ viewport height in px) x 100vh
	1PX IN VW:: 1px = (1/ viewport width in px) x 100vw
	
For example, if your viewport width is 1920 pixels wide, then:

	1PX IN VW:: 1px = (1/ 1920) x 100vw
	= 0.05208vw

And if your viewport height is 1080 pixels tall, then:

	1PX IN VH:: 1px = (1/ 1080) x 100vh
	= 0.09259vh
